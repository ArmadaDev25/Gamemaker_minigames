### Overview
Space Dodger is a game that I built based off the GameMaker Space Rocks Tutorial. I built it as a way to learn Gamemaker. Throughout following the tutorial I added additional code and machanics to the game. I did this using in order to solidify what I was learning as well as challenge myself. 

### Additional Features I Added
- Player Lives - Players can be destoyed 3 additional times in order to give them more chances to score more points. The players remaining lives are indicated at the top left of the screen.
- Game Over Screen - When the player loses all of their lives, they are presented with a Game Over screen where they can retry playing the game.
