### Overview
Space Dodger is a game that I built based off the GameMaker Space Rocks Tutorial. I built it as a way to learn Gamemaker. Throughout following the tutorial I added additional code and machanics to the game. I did this using in order to solidify what I was learning as well as challenge myself.
